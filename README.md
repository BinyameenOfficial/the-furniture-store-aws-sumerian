# The-Furniture-Store
Next Level Digital Signage supported by 3D models and Augmented Reality Application

## Inspiration
As per wikipedia  [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signage) over 200 different companies worldwide market digital signage solutions and the number is still consistently growing. With the influx of digital signage providers, the digital signage market is expected to grow upward to $21.92 Billion USD by 2020, with a CAGR of 8.04% from 2015 to 2020.
  Using AWS Sumerian a digital signage with dynamic content which can be updated over the web , providing latest updates for the products, instant updates on the offers can be provided. Considering the industry segment for the Home and office furniture , A digital signage is required which can provide 3D models, customised offers and instant purchasing options by just scanning the digital signage. In this project I have tried to provide a digital signage with latest features which can attract users in the shop or showrooms and will be attractive in look n feel also. thanks to the multiple features provided by Amazon Sumerian
